  abstract = {The combination of significantly lower cost and increased speed of sequencing has resulted in an explosive growth of data submitted into the primary next-generation sequence data archive, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The preservation of experimental data is an important part of the scientific record, and increasing numbers of journals and funding agencies require that next-generation sequence data are deposited into the SRA. The SRA was established as a public repository for the next-generation sequence data and is operated by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). INSDC partners include the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The SRA is accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra from NCBI, at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena from EBI and at http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp from DDBJ. In this article, we present the content and structure of the SRA, detail our support for sequencing platforms and provide recommended data submission levels and formats. We also briefly outline our response to the challenge of data growth.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating possible benefits of endovascular therapy (EVT) for acute ischaemic stroke has shown conflicting results. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically examine clinical outcomes in RCTs comparing the use of intravenous (IV) fibrinolysis alone to IV fibrinolysis plus EVT, for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected English language RCTs, comparing EVT plus IV tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (if eligible) with IV tPA alone in eligible patients for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. The primary endpoint was good functional outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2]. Other major endpoints of interest were all-cause mortality and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH). The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs that randomized 2423 patients with large-vessel, anterior-circulation stroke. EVT significantly improved the rate of functional independence (90-day mRS of 0-2) when compared with IV fibrinolysis [odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-2.53, number needed to treat (NNT) = 9.3]. The all-cause mortality was lower with EVT compared with the control group; however, the result did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.68-1.15). The rate of sICH was not higher with EVT (OR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.73-1.56). Analyses from only the recent trials (reported in 2014-15) showed further benefit (OR of mRS 0-2: 2.42, 95\% CI 1.91-3.08, NNT = 5) with similar safety results. CONCLUSION: In centres with advanced systems of stroke care, EVT significantly improved functional outcomes (without compromising safety) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to anterior circulation, large artery occlusion, compared with standard therapy.},

  abstract = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {$>$}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

In addition to de novo spliced alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of pseudogenes.

  abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, with astronomical financial repercussions on health systems worldwide. Ischaemic stroke accounts for approximately 80-85\% of all cases and is characterised by the disruption of cerebral blood flow and lack of oxygen to the affected area. Oxidative stress culminates due to an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants and consequent excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are biphasic, playing a role in normal physiological processes and are also implicated in a number of disease processes, whereby they mediate damage to cell structures, including lipids, membranes, proteins, and DNA. The cerebral vasculature is a major target of oxidative stress playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic brain injury following a cerebrovascular attack. Superoxide, the primary reactive oxygen species, and its derivatives have been shown to cause vasodilatation via the opening of potassium channels and altered vascular reactivity, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and focal destructive lesions in animal models of ischaemic stroke. However, reactive oxygen species are involved in normal physiological processes including cell signalling, induction of mitogenesis, and immune defence. Primarily, this review will focus on the cellular and vascular aspects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation and their role in the pathogenesis of ischaemia-reperfusion phenomena. Secondly, the proposed mechanisms of oxidative stress-related neuronal death will be reflected upon and in summation specific targeted neuroprotective therapies targetting oxidative stress and their role in the pathogenesis of stroke will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Neutrophil granulocytes (or polymorphonuclear cells, PMNs) have long been considered as crude killing machines, particularly trained to attack bacterial or fungal pathogens in wounds or infected tissues. That perspective has fundamentally changed over the last decades, as PMNs have been shown to exert a livery exchange between other cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. PMNs do provide major immunomodulatory contribution during acute inflammation and subsequent clearance. Following sterile inflammation like cerebral ischemia, PMNs are among the first hematogenous cells attracted to the ischemic tissue. As inflammation is a crucial component within stroke pathophysiology, several studies regarding the role of PMNs following cerebral ischemia have been carried out. And indeed, recent research suggests a direct connection between PMNs' influx and brain damage severity. This review highlights the latest research regarding the close interconnection between PMNs and co-working cells following cerebral ischemia. We describe how PMNs are attracted to the site of injury and their tasks within the inflamed brain tissue and the periphery. We further report of new findings regarding the interaction of PMNs with resident microglia, immigrating macrophages and T cells after stroke. Finally, we discuss recent research results from experimental studies in the context with current clinical trials and point out potential new therapeutic applications that could emerge from this new knowledge on the action and interaction of PMNs following cerebral ischemia.},
